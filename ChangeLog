        * Inital skeleton installation of the WFCAM survey_agent.pl 
          built. This package is going to be the first 3rd generation
          agent built for the eSTAR project. Initally it should talk
          to the current user_agent.pl and the rest of the 2nd generation
          code, but if Robonet-1.0 goes ahead we'll need to refactor
          the top level User Agent code as it's not robust enough for
          general distribution to astronomers.
